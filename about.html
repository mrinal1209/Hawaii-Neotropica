        <h4> Organization </h4>
        <p>HFNA was incorporated in June 2009 under the provisions of the Hawaii Nonprofit Corporation Act, Hawaii Revised Statues Chapter 414D.&nbsp; The corporation carries on activities permitted a corporation exempt from Federal income tax under Section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.&nbsp; HFNA is recognized as the statewide marketing representative of the Hawaii floriculture and nursery industry.&nbsp; It encapsulates three older organizations: Hawaii Export Nursery Association, incorporated in May 1994 for potted plants; Hawaii Tropical Flower Council, incorporated in December 1990 for cut flowers and foliages; and Orchid Growers of Hawaii, incorporated in February 1995 for potted and cut orchids.</p>
<p>HFNA represents about 400 members in all four counties of the State of Hawaii: Maui, Oahu, Kauai, and Hawaii.&nbsp; Any person, firm, partnership, corporation, incorporated or unincorporated associations, cooperatives, and other entities engaged in or with the intention of pursuing the commercial growing, processing or distribution of nursery products in the State of Hawaii shall be qualified to be active members.</p>
<p>The purpose of HFNA is to a) enhance its members&rsquo; business success through enactment of laws to advance the common business interests of the members&rsquo; education, marketing,<br /> research and services; b) to encourage and promote the betterment of conditions that will create and sustain an economically viable flower and plant industry; and c) to promote Hawaii flowers and plants, both locally and for export.</p>
<h4>Strategic Objectives</h4>
<p>During the next five years, HFNA will focus on the following four key strategic objectives: (1) increase sales of floriculture and nursery products grown in Hawaii by 25 percent in 5 years and double foreign exports in 7 years by entering at least one new or expanding one existing foreign market each year; (2) capture a strong global leadership positioning for Hawaii as being &ldquo;the best&rdquo; for floriculture and nursery products; (3) differentiate floriculture and nursery products grown in Hawaii versus those grown elsewhere; and (4) improve the financial position of the association to conduct mission-related activities.</p>
<h4>Marketing Activities</h4>
<p>In July 2012, HFNA conducted a Hawaii Floriculture Risk Management Symposium to have researchers present current research on-going for the floriculture and nursery product industry.&nbsp; Speakers were from UH CTAHR, ARS PBARC, and HARC.&nbsp; There were 125 industry attendees.</p>
<p>In October 2012, HFNA hosted the annual Tropical Trends Collaboration Now in the 21st Century Conference.&nbsp; The theme was Marketing &amp; Networking &ndash; Building a Branded Marketing Strategy.&nbsp; There were 75 industry attendees.</p>
<p>In 2013, HFNA, as a member of the Synergistic Hawaii Agriculture Council, started its Market Access Program activities for Canada. HFNA&nbsp; hired Bryant Christie Inc. to conduct a Floriculture and Nursery Canada Market Research Study for the Provinces of Ontario and British Columbia.&nbsp; The research study was published in December 2013.&nbsp; In September 2013, a delegation of HFNA Directors representing the three encapsulated organizations made a trip to Canada to visit potential buyers in Toronto in Ontario and Vancouver in British Columbia.&nbsp; HFNA has also developed a logo to brand its products and this website to make buyers and consumers aware of the Hawaii floriculture and nursery industry and its products.</p>
<p>In July 2014 HFNA sponsored a Reverse Trade Mission of Canadian floriculture buyers and distributors to come to Hawaii to visit member nurseries and attend the Hawaii MIDPAC Horticultural Conference &amp; Expo to learn about our products and meet with industry members.</p>
<p>In October 2014 a delegation of five HFNA representatives traveled to Vancouver and Toronto to meet with prospective buyers and distributors and to open discussions on the benefits of Hawaii floriculture products.</p>
<p>In July 2015 HFNA sponsored a Reverse Trade Mission of 10 Canadian floriculture buyers and distributors to come to Hawaii to visit member nurseries and attend the annual Hawaii MIDPAC Horticultural Conference &amp; Expo. The reverse traders learned the value and benefits of Hawaii floriculture products and opened discussions with growers and shippers.</p>
<p>In November 2015 a delegation of three HFNA foliage and potted orchid representatives traveled to Toronto, Ontario for a tour of distributors, auction houses, and wholesalers of floriculture products. 10 contacts were made for future reverse trade missions.</p>
<p>In March 2016 a delegation of two HFNA cut flower growers and shippers traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia to visit distributors and brokers of cut tropical flowers. Contacts were made with potential buyers.<br />In July 2016 HFNA sponsored a Reverse Trade Mission of 9 Canadian floriculture buyers and distributors to come to Hawaii to tour member nurseries to see firsthand the quality and beauty of Hawaii floriculture products. They also attended the Hawaii MIDPAC Horticultural Conference and Expo.</p>
<p>In September 2016 a delegation of three HFNA representatives traveled to Vancouver, British Columbia to create a floral display and man trade booths to make contact with attendees of the 2016 Gateway to the America&rsquo;s Cup International Floral Design Competition. Our delegation also met 58 new contacts at the Special Occasions with Hawaiian Tropicals Design Demonstrations and Workshop by world renowned floral designer Hitomi Gilliam, AIFD.</p>
<p>HFNA has continued plans to propagate and enhance relations with potential Canadian buyers and distributors of floriculture products throughout 2017.</p>
<h4>Product Characteristics</h4>
<p>The crux to increase demand and sales is high quality, but it is not resolved by research and development alone. In 2011, HFNA started a project to establish quality standards for export of all product lines for approval by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture. Once the quality standards are approved, a methodology to ensure compliance will be established and certifications ascertained. HFNA will use marketing venues to periodically validate its standards with buyers.</p>
<p>Consumers identify brilliant colors, uniqueness, variety of colors, and a wide variety of types as attributes which they think make Hawaii grown flowers better than those grown in other places. Retailers and wholesalers consider Hawaii grown flowers to be superior to other flowers with regard to consistent floral quality, condition of flowers upon arrival and reliable supply. Recommended unique selling points for interior foliage plants and blooming plants are superior quality backed by industry standards, longevity, exceptional colors, product freshness and the use of Hawaiian cinder soil media.</p>
